# Vercel

## Requirements

You need a PostgresDB database hosted somewhere. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) offer great free options.

## Getting Started

### Local settings

1. Fork and clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/cal.com.git
   ```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env` and fill it with your settings ([See manual setup](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#manual) and [Obtaining the Google API Credentials](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com#obtaining-the-google-api-credentials))

3. Install packages with `yarn`

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `prisma/schema.prisma`)

   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

5. Open [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:
   ```
   npx prisma studio
   ```
6. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
7. Fill out the fields (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
8. Open a browser to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000) on your localhost and login with your just created, first user.

### Deployment

1. Create a new project on Vercel
2. Import from your forked repository
3. Set the Environment Variables
4. Hit Deploy
