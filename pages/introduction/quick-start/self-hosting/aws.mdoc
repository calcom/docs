### 1-click installation

Deploy the open-source version of Cal.com on AWS with the community-supported [AWS Stacksnap installer](https://klo.dev/stacksnap/apps/calcom/). It sets up an ECS task running the community Docker image, a Postgres DB on RDS for data storage, and an Application Load Balancer for exposure and scalability.
