## API Versions

We offer two versions of our API: the legacy version (V1) and the latest V2 version. While both versions are currently available, we highly recommend using the V2 API in all your integrations and applications.

### Why Use V2?

The V2 API includes numerous enhancements and new features that are not available in V1. It has been designed to be more efficient, secure, and easier to use. V2 reflects our commitment to providing the best possible developer experience and ensuring that your applications can take advantage of the latest advancements in our platform.

### Deprecation Notice for V1

{% note type="warning" %}
Please note that the V1 API will be officially deprecated starting January 2025. This means that after this date, we will no longer provide updates, fixes, or support for the V1 API. We encourage all developers and users to migrate their applications to the V2 API well before this date to avoid any disruptions.

- **User friendly response objects**: In V2 we have focused heavily on improving the response object for a better User Experience.
- **Enhanced Security**: V2 includes improved security measures to protect your data.

We are committed to supporting our community during this transition. If you have any questions or need assistance with migrating to the V2 API, please refer to our [migration guide](#) or contact our support team.
