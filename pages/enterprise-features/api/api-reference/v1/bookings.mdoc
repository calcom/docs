These routes allow you to CRUD bookings within Cal.com

## Admin access

This endpoint supports System Wide Admin access, as well as Organization Wide Admin access. 

> As an Organization Admin, you can now query bookings for your Organization members, be it GET, POST, PATCH, or DELETE


## Pagination

We have added pagination to this endpoint to handle large responses. You can now use the `take` and `page` query parameters to get the specific batch of bookings you need. 

- `take`: The maximum number of bookings you want in a batch.
- `page`: The page number to retrieve the bookings from, based on the total number of bookings divided by `take`.

### Example:
If there are 100 total bookings and you set `take` to 25, there will be 4 pages of bookings. To get bookings 26-50, set `page` to 2.

### Usage:
- `take`: Maximum number of bookings per batch (e.g., 25)
- `page`: Page number to retrieve (e.g., 2)

This way, you can easily navigate through large sets of bookings by specifying how many bookings you want per batch and which batch to retrieve.

> **Note: Pagination is optional, in the absence of `take` and `page`, the response will contain all bookings.**
