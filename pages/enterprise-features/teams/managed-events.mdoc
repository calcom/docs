Team admins now have the ability to manage event-types for their members, to facilitate creating common event-types for all members and managing them from one place.

A managed event-type comes with certain fields locked by the team admin, and certain fields open to be modified by the team members receiving the managed event.

{% note type="info" %}Please take into account that Managed Events v2 do not support Webhooks and Apps. Subsequent releases of this feature will tackle them. {% /note %}

## Creation

Be sure to be a team admin, and in case you are self-hosting, have the `managed-event-types`` operational feature flag turned on.

When creating a team event-type, you will be getting the option to create a Managed Event like so:

## Management

Once the managed event-type is created, you will be able to set all the fields you want to manage as a team admin. You can distinguish fields that will be locked by team members by the "lock" icon next to the field label, like so:

### Assignment

A crucial part of a managed event-type is the assignment of team members, so managed event-types can be created on your behalf.

Think of the managed-event you created as a team admin as an event template, that team members will get regular event types from it once they are assign to it.

{% note type="warning" %}Whenever you make changes to locked fields, every team member will also get the same change on their regular event type created upon this managed event-type. Note that unlocked fields will not have any effect on already created event types for assigned members, only for new assign members.{% /note %}

Take into consideration that whenever you try to assign a managed event-type to a team member that already has an event-type with the same slug, you will be getting a pop-up message to confirm you want to proceed to delete the existing conflicting event-type from the team member and notify them about this so the managed-event type can be created in its place. Like so:

For which, team members notified will be getting the following email notification.
